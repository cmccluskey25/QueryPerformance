Query Design Analysis notes

IsNull clause can change query plan if need it to include row. Making columns non null or have filterd index on nulls helps with this
Like '%L' rather than substring(  ,1,1)
IN - non sargable.  Does use indexes but can result in multiple scans
Local vars used in WHERE can cause insufficient queries, i.e. assume default statistics of 3% when used with equality

All four SQL statements SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and UPDATE use database locks to isolate their work from tha to other SQL statements.
This add performance overhead.
If all queries are reads, consider :
1. Reducing lock granularity but using PaGLOCK hint in query
2. Set the database to Read only
3. Place specific tables on a filegropu and set as READONLY
4. Prevent SELECT statements from requesting locks using NOLOCK
