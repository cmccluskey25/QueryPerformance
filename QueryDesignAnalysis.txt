Query Design Analysis notes

All four SQL statements SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and UPDATE use database locks to isolate their work from tha to other SQL statements.
This add performance overhead.
If all queries are reads, consider :
1. Reducing lock granularity but using PaGLOCK hint in query
2. Set the database to Read only
3. Place specific tables on a filegropu and set as READONLY
4. Prevent SELECT statements from requesting locks using NOLOCK
